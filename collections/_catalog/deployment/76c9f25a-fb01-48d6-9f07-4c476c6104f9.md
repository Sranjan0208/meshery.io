patternInfo: |
  This Kubernetes configuration defines a set of resources within the byteverse-shecodes namespace. Here's a breakdown of the resources:**Namespace: byteverse-shecodes**- Creates a new Kubernetes namespace called byteverse-shecodes.**Service: apache-service**- Type: LoadBalancer- Namespace: byteverse-shecodes- Selects pods with the label app: apache-web as its backend.- Exposes port 80 and routes traffic to the pods.- This service allows external access to the Apache web servers.**Deployment: apache-deployment**- Namespace: byteverse-shecodes- Replicas: 2, indicating that it will manage two pods.- Selects pods with the label app: apache-web for deployment.- Specifies the container image httpd:2.4.46 for the Apache web server.- Mounts a ConfigMap named apache-config at /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to configure Apache.- This deployment ensures that two instances of the Apache web server are running.**ConfigMap: apache-config**- Namespace: byteverse-shecodes- Provides configuration data for Apache in the httpd.conf key.- The configuration includes settings like listening on port 80 and defining the document root.**Ingress: apache-ingress**- Namespace: byteverse-shecodes- Defines an Ingress resource for routing external traffic.- Sets the host to byteverseshecodes.soni-hetvihetvi.repl.co.- Routes all traffic at the root path (/) to the apache-service service. This configuration sets up Apache web servers with two replicas, exposes them through a LoadBalancer service, and manages the routing of external traffic using an Ingress resource. It also provides a custom configuration for Apache through a ConfigMap.
patternCaveats: |
  Networking should be properly configured to enable communication between pod and services. Ensure sufficient resources are available in the cluster.
